            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Superior Rejuvenation Home Services is the culmination of 20+ years of experience in the remodel and new construction building trades.</p>
            <p>In 1999 General Contractor Dan Brye, a lifelong Clark County resident, WWW alumni, and father, decided to augment his then salary at a job by helping a friend in his construction business.</p>
            <p>This, enfold, lead to an apprenticeship in multiple trades over the years and following that, saw Dan employing his services as a subcontractor for a local builder, often working on four to six houses a month during busy times.</p>
            <p>In the years that followed, Dan provided full service remodels for his Northwest customers to fill the area's growing housing market.</p>
            <p>Through the course of his many project completions, Dan early on recognized the need for a general contractor who listened to his customer's needs and had the ability to see the project through their eyes. He understandes the importance of the details and exceeds his customers' expectaions because of his passion for building and remodeling.</p>
