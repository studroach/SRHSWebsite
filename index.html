                    <p><b>Project Date: </b>November 2022</p>
                    <p>Superior Rejuvenation renovated my kitchen and bathroom with new flooring and counters. It was a challenging job as he had to replace sub-flooring in my 1920s house. He had to tailor make a place for my dishwasher as well. The owner Dan also put in walls, a ceiling, and flooring in an outdoor shed, turning it into a cozy and light-filled office space. He made large cedar flower boxes for the front windows, and subcontracted carpet installing on the second floor. I found working with Dan a delight, as he was honest, trustworthy, skilled, and efficient. I heartedly recomend Dan Brye as a contractor, for both large and small jobs!</p>
